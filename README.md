## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
This library is aimed towards reduction in the number of illiterate(literally) often malicious script-kiddies by teaching them or [trolling](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Trolling) them otherwise, teaching them to be honest and responsible about their decisions.  
Perhaps this would clear some of the mis-conceptions of general public (atleast script-kiddies) created by weird movies.

This package would be disguised and marketed as an omnipotent hacking tool which can help in hacking anything from your ex's Instagram to NASA likewise, giving them pseudo-functionality to momentarily believe that the tool works and then pulling out the bait (some creative way which is either non-harmful but embarrasing or reversibly-pseudo-harmful so that they learn otherwise).
The README would be changed in future iterations promising to be a valid-looking tool. Script kiddies wont bother looking into git-history :smile:
